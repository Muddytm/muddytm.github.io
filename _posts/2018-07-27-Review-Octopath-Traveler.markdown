Finally, I've decided to actually act upon the whole "oh yeah, I'm gonna write a
review for [game] soon!" thing that I've been declaring on Twitter roughly four
or five...dozen times now.. And lo and behold, it's about the game that, by all
appearances to any who've been following my inane rambling about it, I've been
practically foaming at the mouth over. But was I *really*, or was it all merely a
fantastic jape, fueled by the kind of mind that would willingly play a JRPG in
the first place? Keep reading to find out. Or don't, but you're already here, so.

Anyways, the game in question is none other than Octopath Traveler! Not a game about an octopus who travels
on a path, as freaking awesome as that might've been, but instead a veritable
cornucopia of storylines following eight distinct characters. And by
"cornucopia" I mean a very large plate with 8 different kinds of food all
segregated into their own little zones where they don't touch each other because
of course that would be gross.

Yes, I'm afraid to say that Octopus Wrangler pretty much faceplants right out of the
gate in the whole "story" aspect; during the eight
storylines, **the character's paths do not cross.** Not even once. Which is a bit of
a downer for anyone who was looking forward to this game for the promise of an
engaging story with lots of character interactions, especially since even the individual storylines are pretty darn
weak on their own, with only a handful of chapters being excellent from start to
end.

Since this review is coming about 2 weeks after the release of the game, you're
probably reading this with the knowledge of what other reviewers have already
pointed out about the game, i.e. bad dialogue, good combat, jarring cutscenes
where the party members mysteriously vanish. Maybe you've played it yourself and
found it severely lacking, and dropped it (which you have every right to, 'cause
*hoooo boy* it's got a slow boil). That being said, I have more I'd like to say about
certain aspects of the game that no other reviewer I've seen has touched on in depth so
far, but I'll go ahead and briefly go over the obvious.

**YES, the dialogue BLOWS.** It's really, really bad, almost to a painful degree,
and there's a *lot* of it. "Oh, there's a lot of dialogue? Perfect, that means
more character development!" you might say, but this is a JRPG we're talking about, and believe me when I say I have
never seen less actually *said* in a conversation, in contrast to how long these
scenes go for. It's actually kind of impressive - you could literally skip an
entire scene and come out of the end with a 90% accurate idea of what just
occurred.

The whole thing is in dire need of an editor, presumably a better one than Capcom's,
who by all appearances didn't even show up for work. Conversations drag on and
often they only happen for the purpose of intensifying the character's nobility
and/or resolve in their mission. Maybe in a way this is a good thing, since by
story's end you know the character's motivations in and out, but I can't help
but feel the core writing principle of *"show, don't tell"* has not only been
completely ignored, but shot, buried, and purged with fire and salt by the writers.

Interestingly enough, the voice acting is actually pretty good and I'd
recommend playing with them on, unless you're on an Ophilia quest, in which case
I'd recommend hammering stakes into your ears instead. It's bad.

**YES, the combat is good!** And I'll be honest, it's probably the one thing
that actually pushed me through the game. It starts out with a simple concept
(stun enemies by hitting them with their weaknesses), and by the time you're
fighting the final bosses you'll be juggling boost points, buffs, and
enemy debuffs, and setting up break timings so that you can get the most out of
a single break. And what's also great about it is that there's very little
hand-holding; enemies start off with simple weaknesses but progressively get a
lot harder to deal with, especially in boss fights where they apply special
buffs to themselves (and debuffs to the player) that require a whole different
approach to the system. So it's got a nice amount of depth that keeps me from
falling asleep the way that other JRPGs do.

The flipside to this is that since all the combat in this game requires a
certain amount of strategy, grinding random encounters can be an absolute chore.
But more on this later when I hit you with the less-obvious gripes I had with
the game.

**NO, the individual stories have nothing to do with each other.** I said this
earlier, but truth be told, there is some lore that chains the stories together
in a post-endgame questline and dungeon. I don't really count this as much of a
plus, though, since you know...you *have to complete the game entirely
before you even have a clue what the overarching story is.*

So then we get to the real question - does the story actually only *really*
begin once all characters' storylines have been completed? In a way...yes. I
mean, you can't get the *true* ending otherwise. It took me 40-something hours
to complete all 8 stories from beginning to end so I'll go on record and say this
is probably the longest prologue I've ever experienced.

Worth mentioning are the character interactions (called "travel banter" in-game),
which is the closest the game gets to the original narrative concept that pretty
much everyone was expecting. The way it works is that, after certain events
starting in the chapter 2 segments forwards, certain members of your current party
will have something to say. It's pretty much only flavor text, and I feel like it
sometimes contrasts with the game's method of storytelling - that method being
pretending your entire party doesn't exist.

Still, there are a *lot* of potential travel banter segments, so if that's what
floats your boat then you will find your boat very afloat indeed.

Finally, **YES, the aesthetic of this game is fantastic.** The scenery is
constantly changing wherever you go, which keeps things fresh. Even though there
aren't that many types of dungeons to visit (caves, forests, ruins, sewers, and
mansions), the color scheme and music are switched up often enough to make every area
feel just a bit different. The same goes with the overworld - you have your
standard array of locations to visit (grasslands, mountains, deserts, canyons,
etc.), but they're a pleasure to look at. There's also a ridiculous amount of loot
to find, though I'm going to have to give demerits to whoever had the bright idea
of making some chests accessible to Therion only. To whoever came up with
this - I'll call you Jerry - screw you Jerry, that's just a dick move.

I could also go on about the music and how it's one of the best soundtracks (if
not *the* best) that I've heard this year, but I think these topics have
been talked about enough on end by more prominent game critics so I'll just hop
into my personal, less-talked about aspects of Octopork Broiler.

First off, the game actually has pretty freaking decent pacing, which is something I've experienced
very little of in JRPGs. Even games like Earthbound lost me pretty early on,
simply because nothing was happening in a timely manner (before you send me
hatemail, I'm going to give it another shot right after I submit this post, so get outta here nerd).
The secret sauce is in the chapter system. Every
chapter (barring a couple) follows the same recipe: start out with some exposition (words, words,
words), use a path action, more dialogue, go to a dungeon, fight a boss. It rarely changes from this formula.
The neat thing is that these chapters are bite-sized in length; they'll take the
average player anywhere from one to two hours to complete, and they end with
what is arguably the best part of the game - the boss battles (more on that in a
minute).

**That being said,** the first 8-10 hours are a doozy, when you've gotta go around
and collect all the characters. Hope you like 10 hours of character
introductions! Truth be told, I was tempted to give up near the end of this part
of the game, but I paid 60 bucks for this thing so I wasn't giving up that
easily. This is the slowest part of the game and you're well within your rights
to throw in the towel, but in the immortal words of that monkey guy from Bojack
Horseman - "It does get easier. But you gotta endure a lot of inane dialogue BS.
But it does get easier." Or something like that.

I'd also like to give a big ol' wet smooch right on the lips to whoever made the executive decision
to forgo level restrictions on equipment. Relatedly, I would also recommend looking up
where the best armor and weapons are as you get deeper into the game, because
the locations of these tend to be quite obscure, and if you can buy them and/or
steal them then they can make even your lowest-level characters into absolute units.
If you manage your equipment correctly, you can offset the tedium of grinding by quite a bit.

On that note, we are forced to look it dead in the eyes - the inevitability of every
JRPG to have at least one section almost entirely dedicated to grinding. If
you're like me, and want to experience the game by actually playing the chapters
one after the other, instead of grinding Ultra-Beef Tortoises out in the endgame
areas, then you'll find yourself a considerable amount of levels short for the
final bosses in the eight characters' questlines. At this point, I found that
the biggest problem was lack of HP - bosses can, and often will, nearly
one-shot lower-leveled characters - and in a game where high-level combat is
reliant on setting up character actions to synergize with each other, a dead
character is a dog turd bullet right between the eyes. So take my aforementioned
advice, and make sure your boys (and gals) are well equipped, especially if they're
underleveled.

Worth noting here is another form of XP called JP ("Job Points") which
allow characters to unlock abilities for the 12 total subclasses. Each
subclass's abilities are only available for the character if they are equipped
with that subclass, but "support skills" earned from unlocking abilities in the
subclass can be equipped with no restrictions. This creates endgame scenarios
where you might want (just as an example) the Warrior skill "Surpassing Power"
to pimp out your Scholar's damage numbers, but must invest nearly 10,000 JP to make it happen.
It's an unnecessary amount of grinding, to say the least.

For these reasons, I heavily recommend looking up character builds online if you're
unsure in your decisions, especially for the later parts of the game. It'll save
you a lot of time, even if you are being a dirty freaking cheater whose parents
are disappointed in you.

The boss battles are probably the highlights of the game, and while a lot of care has gone
into tarting up the sprites of all eighty billion enemies in this game (give or take),
it's clear to see that extra care has been given to the boss sprites. They look
completely intimidating and some of them are hilariously nonsensical (i.e. a guy
that was apparently secretly hiding a horse underneath him during the preceding cutscene),
but they're always fantastic. They're also some
of the most unique encounters in the game, possessing abilities you won't see
anywhere else and forcing the player to come up with alternative strategies.
Minor spoilers for a couple cool things you'll see later in the game: a boss that
obscures the character turns UI, a boss that slowly whittles down your max HP,
and a boss that takes a *really, really* long time to break.

I should also comb over some of my gripes with the combat - even though it's generally
great, it's not as smart as it pretends to be in some places. There are two kinds of attacks:
physical (swords, polearms, daggers, axes, bows, and staves), and elemental (fire, ice, lightning,
wind, light and dark). An enemy's weaknesses will be comprised of a certain number
of these, but the actual weapons and elements themselves have no secondary effect, unless you've specifically equipped a weapon that does so.
Physical attacks can miss, and can also be boosted to strike up to 4 times (useful for breaking), while
elemental attacks cannot miss, but (besides a select few abilities) can only strike
once. It would've been nice if (just for example) ice moves caused a speed debuff, or
daggers reduced armor or something. As it is, the types of weapons and elements are
basically only there for quantity's sake, so that it won't be *too* easy to guess
at what a target's weaknesses are.

That's basically all I've got to say. So, all-in-all, as someone who generally doesn't care for JRPGs, I enjoyed this
game a lot. It has its own set of problems (uninteresting stories, too much
grinding), but it also has major strengths in its aesthetic, combat, and decent
pacing (for a JRPG, that is). Unfortunately, since JRPG fans are generally in
the mood for a game with a story more complex than putting butter on toast,
this is a game that will only really appeal strongly to a very small
demographic. I happened to be in this demographic, and I will admit that I'm now
convinced JRPGs are a thing I might be able to get into.
