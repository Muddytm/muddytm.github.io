Hi there. This is where I keep all my reviews of games that I play and feel the urge to talk about.

My general criteria for judging whether a game is good or not are measured by whether or not I had fun with the game - the challenge this poses to me is to write about the game in a way that deconstructs my perception of the game, so I can better communicate about what it is that makes the game good in some ways and bad in others.

For this reason (among others) I don't like giving scores; it's an unfair assessment of the medium, because some games are amazing in some ways while simultaneously being dreadful in others.

Feel free to send any questions or comments to me via my email or on Twitter. Or, heck, on Twitch if I'm streaming.
