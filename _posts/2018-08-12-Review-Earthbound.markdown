Alright friends, I hope you have a chair with a fairly comfortable edge, because you're going to be on the end of it by the time I finish this sentence; before just recently, *I've never played Earthbound before.*

Well, that's not quite true, actually. I've tried no less than THREE times in the past to penetrate this brick wall of a game, but it simply would not let me in. The reason for this would always change: first it was boredom, caused by the rather unwarranted amount of grinding required for the first part of the game. Then it was frustration, thanks to a little area ironically named "Peaceful Rest Valley", and finally it was due to anti-piracy measures that I learned about the hard way when trying to emulate the game on PC. After three tries and no success, I felt like maybe I just wasn't "getting" it.

However, with newfound determination gleaned from actually finishing my first JRPG in years (see my review for Octopath Traveler), I managed to break through the wall and actually beat the game! Finally. Only took...what, ten years?

So, here's what I thought about this 24 year-old game.

First off, I now understand why people call this game a classic - it's all in the story, as it should be for any decent JRPG. The pacing is a bit of a pisser for the first couple towns, but after I was through Twoson and the Happy Happyist Cult (and subsequently obtain your second party member), the plot picked up tremendously. The player moves on from there to a town infested with zombies and sentient circus tents, to a city with an evil "mirror" dimension underneath (complete with enemies varying from melting clocks to angry fire hydrants), to a gold mine filled with giant moles who all believe they're the third-best of the bunch, and so on. What's also great about these goofy plot points is that the game keeps them coming, right up until the end, making the entire experience unforgettable. Every hour I spent playing Earthbound was enough time for more than a few completely-bananas moments to occur, and the game honestly became hard to put down after a while because I wanted to see what would happen next.

The writing itself didn't really blow my mind - most NPCs talk in a manner befitting someone who belongs squarely in the loony bin. But I think that's what makes this game work from a narrative standpoint; the whole thing carries with it a sense of childlike innocence that keeps the experience feeling surreal, yet undeniably charming. Everyone and everything in the game is utterly nuts, yet it doesn't seem to faze Ness and friends. They never comment on any of the crazy stuff going on around them, and as a result it became almost expected that every place I went and everyone I met would come with its own set of quirks. It's a good thing, then, that Earthbound continually gets stranger and more surreal in order to keep surprising the player, right up until the very end when - well, I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't played, but I hope you're prepared for a sudden dose of cosmic horror.

It's worth pointing out that there are some really nice features that should probably be commonplace. There are no random encounters, with every enemy appearing in the overworld individually. If you get too close they'll run at you, and you can generally take them on one at a time this way. Additionally, if the enemy is significantly underleveled compared to your current party, the game just says "yeah, we all know how this is going to turn out" and wins the battle for you. Some enemies will actually run away from your party to avoid getting stepped on, and finishing a dungeon applies this cowardice to every enemy in the dungeon. The game's health system is also quite unique, displayed as a meter that ticks down when damage is dealt to a party member; if the encounter is finished while the HP is still ticking down (even if it's a mortal blow), the game just forgets about it. It's a godsend for some areas of the game, but sadly it didn't work to my advantage all that often until several hours in when my kids had more HP.

Some stuff hasn't aged well. The inventory system is pretty awful, and it was a huge pain for me to deal with key items since they can't be dropped when their only purpose has been met. Instead, I had to find a phone, call delivery, wait for the delivery guy to arrive, and then hand him three items *maximum* at a time. Rinse and repeat for all the useless key items I had. To make this worse, there are a couple key items that are used once early on in the game, and then once more near the very end of the game. So if you're like me and hold onto items that have a 1% chance of being used later on, you're going to find yourself starved of space that would usually hold more Peanut Cheese Bars and Cups of Life Noodles to keep Paula from dying every time she's sneezed at by an enemy coffee cup or something.

"But what about the combat?"

Ooooh. What *about* the combat.

It's functional but bland...and later in the game, very bad. Consequently, it's the reason I might have an issue recommending this game for some people. But can I go on a tangent for a second? No? Whatever, I'm going to anyways.

I'm no expert in this genre (clearly), but for me, combat in JRPGs is generally about as engaging as blowing bubbles with my own spit. It's almost always turn-based, but a good JRPG can generally make up for this by making the combat engaging in some way, usually by adding a gimmick or making it a strategic matter, for example. The Paper Mario games (well, the first and second ones) manage to make turn-based combat pretty fun by filling it with little mini-games whenever a move is executed, forcing the player to be on their toes even when the moves are mid-animation. Octopath Traveler has turn-based combat as well, but it comes with a reasonably deep strategic battle system that stays engaging (if maybe a little long-winded) by even making standard enemy encounters more of a puzzle than a show of brute strength.

But in truth, JRPGs/RPGs are really about the story, and the combat is usually only there so that it can be called a game and not a visual novel. This is why I couldn't easily recommend Octopath Traveler; the individual stories and overarching plot generally sucked, and for a game that calls itself a JRPG, that's an unforgivable sin. On the opposite end, I call Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door one of my favorite games of all time because it has a good story, memorable characters, fantastic dialogue, and combat that's actually *fun.*

So what makes Earthbound's combat notable in its badness? Well, for starters, it gets a big demerit for having the gonads to make me grind for levels at the *very beginning of the game.* The enemies at the beginning of the game are tough for solo Ness, and I found myself going back and forth between attacking and healing far more often than I really felt I ought to. Then, when I was out of psychic points, I got to head out of the dungeon and back to the hotel for more. It's incredibly misleading as a first impression, because the combat really isn't so bad after that.

...Well, until near the end. At this point the difficulty curve makes a *massive* upward climb and it becomes preferable to simply avoid enemies entirely or eat a giant grind sandwich, because every encounter becomes something that will probably kill Paula. I say "Paula" and not "a team member" because let's face it, Paula has glass bones and paper skin. She dies to *everything.* The final combat encounter turned my other three kids into an extended life-support system in order to help Paula not die constantly to a gentle Spring breeze.

Oh, and more on avoiding enemies - you can avoid enemy encounters by stepping away from them and letting them unload off-screen, and then walking back to (hopefully) a better arrangement of enemies, or no enemies at all. The problem I had with this is that sometimes, I'd just get *really* unlucky. Oftentimes I would clear out an area, get an item at the end of the path, and come back to more enemies than there were before. To add to the frustration, some dungeons are designed in such a way where doing this little dance often would lead to enemies being spawned where I just came from, while at the same time I'd be trying to despawn enemies ahead of me, essentially creating more combat encounters. Not cool.

One of the game's most memorable areas is dampened by the fact that Ness must go there alone, and the experience is cheapened by the fact that the enemies are *unreasonably* strong. I actually consulted the magic of Google for help because I was honestly wondering if I had missed a major plot point and was far too underleveled for the area, but NOPE, it's just that hard.

Overall, though, I enjoyed Earthbound, and I would recommend it to anyone who can deal with these issues. The issues I had aren't at all dealbreakers, but I'd be lying if I said they didn't dampen the experience somewhat, especially at the end of the game when things get especially nutty. If you're an avid JRPG fan then you've probably already played Earthbound, but if you haven't then you know what to do. As for myself, I'm feeling pretty triumphant. This is a long game, and it really feels like an adventure - and I really don't think another game will be able to replicate this experience for a very long time.

Well, until Nintendo localizes Mother 3.
